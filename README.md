# Iris Flower Classification

This project demonstrates a basic machine learning workflow using the Iris flower dataset. It includes data loading, exploration, visualization, and model training to classify the species of Iris flowers.

## 📂 Project Structure

* **Notebook**: `Iris flower classification.ipynb` – Main Jupyter notebook with all the code and outputs.
* **Dataset**: The Iris dataset is loaded directly using `scikit-learn`.

## 🧰 Libraries Used

* `pandas`
* `numpy`
* `scikit-learn`
* `matplotlib`
* `seaborn`

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the notebook.
2. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install scikit-learn pandas matplotlib seaborn
   ```
3. Open the notebook in JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebook, or any supported environment.
4. Run the cells sequentially.

## 📊 Features

* Load and inspect the Iris dataset.
* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using plots and summary statistics.
* Train machine learning models like:

  * K-Nearest Neighbors
  * Decision Trees
* Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy.

## 🔍 Dataset Information

The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers, with 4 features:

* Sepal length
* Sepal width
* Petal length
* Petal width
  Each sample is labeled as one of three species: `setosa`, `versicolor`, or `virginica`.

## 🧠 Model Evaluation

The notebook includes training and testing phases for multiple models, along with evaluation metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrices to compare their performance.

## 📌 Conclusion

This project serves as an introduction to basic machine learning techniques and classification tasks using Python and its data science ecosystem.
